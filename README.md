📁 Python Libraries Summary
=============================

This repository section covers all major Python libraries essential for Data Science, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning. Below is a folder-wise summary:

1. 🔹 Matplotlib and Seaborn
   - Data visualization using:
     - `Matplotlib`: line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, axes, labels, titles, and customization.
     - `Seaborn`: advanced statistical plots like heatmaps, pairplots, countplots, boxplots, violin plots, etc.
   - Style themes and color palettes for better presentation.

2. 🔹 Pandas
   - Complete data handling with `pandas`:
     - Reading data (`read_csv`, `read_excel`)
     - DataFrame operations: filtering, indexing, slicing
     - Handling missing values
     - GroupBy, merging, joining, sorting
     - Aggregation and data transformation

3. 🔹 Plotly
   - Interactive data visualizations:
     - Line, bar, pie, scatter, bubble charts
     - 3D plots and maps
     - Layout and animation customization
   - Usage of `plotly.graph_objects` and `plotly.express` modules.

4. 🔹 Plotly Again
   - Revisit and practice of more advanced or refined Plotly concepts:
     - More complex visualizations
     - Dashboard-style interactive charts

5. 🔹 Scikit-Learn
   - Machine learning basics and model building:
     - Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding)
     - Model training: classification & regression
     - Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1, confusion matrix)
     - Train-test split, pipelines, and hyperparameter tuning

6. 🔹 NumPy
   - Numerical computing foundation:
     - Arrays and matrix operations
     - Indexing, slicing, reshaping
     - Broadcasting and vectorization
     - Mathematical, statistical, and linear algebra functions
